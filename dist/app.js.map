Leaflet takes two options in consideration\n * for computing tooltip offseting:\n * - the `offset` Tooltip option: it defaults to [0, 0], and it's specific to one tooltip.\n *   Add a positive x offset to move the tooltip to the right, and a positive y offset to\n *   move it to the bottom. Negatives will move to the left and top.\n * - the `tooltipAnchor` Icon option: this will only be considered for Marker.
